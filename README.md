Tutorial: iOS 8 Notifications
======================

A quick demo to show how to work with the new iOS 8 notification actions.

Shows the new way to register for notifications, create notification actions and categories, then handle that action.

Based almost entirely off of the [WWDC 2014 session video "What's New in iOS Notifications"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/), but for some reason I couldn't find any documentation about how to make notification actions.

Short blog post about it (here)[http://davegaeddert.com/2014/09/16/ios-8-notification-actions/].
